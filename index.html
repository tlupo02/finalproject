            <p>For my final project, I would like to a website highlighting the legendary band Queen. I am thinking of the home page being a small description of the band including their most popular songs, and then three subpages: The History of the Band (how they met and what their career looked like until Freddie Mercury's death), The discography of the band, with the consensus of each with sources from critics, and a third being what the band is like today after the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury.</p>
